For custom ARAM matches in League of Legends. Custom matches do not supply 're-rolls' and have to use the honor system when selecting champions. This tool allows the creation of custom matches and will take into account each player's champion pool and the free-week rotation to supply each player 1 champion and two re-roll options.
